# ✈️ U.S. Flights 2023 Dashboard  

This project was developed as part of the **Business Decision Support Systems (MIS41040)** module at **UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School** by **Sumit Karpe, Andrew, and Claudio**.  

We analyzed **7M+ U.S. domestic flights (2023)** to build an **interactive Decision Support System (DSS)** in Power BI, uncovering patterns in **airlines, airports, manufacturers, and delays**. The dashboards allow stakeholders to explore operational performance, identify bottlenecks, and support data-driven decision-making.

## 🔹 Features  
- **Interactive dashboards** with slicers & filters (airline, airport, manufacturer, aircraft type, month, departure/arrival, etc.).  
- **Geospatial mapping** of flight density, routes, and airports.  
- **Delay analytics** – departure vs. arrival delays, seasonal trends, causes of delay.  
- **Airline & manufacturer insights** – market share, aircraft age vs. delays, model-level analysis.  
- **Correlation analysis** between departure and arrival delays.  
- **Comparative state-level data** on expenditure and enplanements.

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Southwest Airlines** led in flight count (~1.4M), followed by Delta and American Airlines.  
- **Boeing (46%) and Airbus (29%)** dominated U.S. skies in 2023.  
- **Summer months (July–August)** had peak delays, aligning with travel demand surges.  
- **DFW and DEN airports** were leading hubs, with high departure and arrival volumes.  
- **Carrier-related and NAS (National Aviation System) issues** were top causes of delays.
